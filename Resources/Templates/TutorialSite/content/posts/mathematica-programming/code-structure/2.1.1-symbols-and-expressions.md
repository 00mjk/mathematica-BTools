## Symbols and Expressions

### Symbols

Mathematica has one more basic type than those mentioned before:  notebookToMarkdownFEExport[<|Root -> /Users/Mark/Library/Mathematica/ApplicationData/WebSites/tutorial, Path -> ../../../.., Name -> 2.1.1-symbols-and-expressions, ContentExtension -> content, Meta -> {Title -> Symbols and Expressions, Slug -> Automatic, Path -> Mathematica Programming/Code Structure/Symbols and Expressions, ID -> {2.1.1}, Date -> Wed 27 Dec 2017 16:11:34, Modified -> Wed 27 Dec 2017 16:11:34, Authors -> {}, Categories -> {mathematica-programming, code-structure}, Tags -> {symbols, expressions}}, Notebook -> NotebookObject[FrontEndObject[LinkObject[…]], 255], Context -> Global`|>, BoxData[FormBox[Symbol, TextInlineCell]], PlainText]

In reality, every variable we’ve used and function we’ve defined (excluding pure functions) has been a symbol.

One thing to keep in mind is that the only things that can have properties or values in Mathematica are symbols, although a symbol need not have any.

All of the following are symbols:

	Automatic
	AxesLabel
	$ModuleNumber
	Rule
	SetDelayed

	(*Out:*)
	
	Automatic

	(*Out:*)
	
	AxesLabel

	(*Out:*)
	
	1205

	(*Out:*)
	
	Rule

	(*Out:*)
	
	SetDelayed

### Expressions

In Mathematica, they say everything is an expression. What this means, really, is that outside of the primitive types everything has one common form:

	(head)[arg1, arg2, arg2, ..., argn]

Furthermore, there are tools to parse these structures:

	{1, 2, 3} // FullForm

	(*Out:*)
	
	TagBox[StyleBox[RowBox[{"List","[",RowBox[{"1",",","2",",","3"}],"]"}],ShowSpecialCharacters->False,ShowStringCharacters->True,NumberMarks->True],FullForm]

This even applies to things like graphics. Consider the following graphic:

	Graphics3D[Sphere[], Boxed -> False, Lighting -> "Neutral", 
	 ImageSize -> Small]

	(*Out:*)
	
![21-3746347517276191002]({filename}/img/21-3746347517276191002.png)

It is, however, still just an expression:

	Graphics3D[Sphere[], Boxed -> False, Lighting -> "Neutral", 
	  ImageSize -> Small] // FullForm

	(*Out:*)
	
	TagBox[StyleBox[RowBox[{"Graphics3D","[",RowBox[{RowBox[{"Sphere","[",RowBox[{"List","[",RowBox[{"0",",","0",",","0"}],"]"}],"]"}],",",RowBox[{"Rule","[",RowBox[{"Boxed",",","False"}],"]"}],",",RowBox[{"Rule","[",RowBox[{"Lighting",",","\"Neutral\""}],"]"}],",",RowBox[{"Rule","[",RowBox[{"ImageSize",",","Small"}],"]"}]}],"]"}],ShowSpecialCharacters->False,ShowStringCharacters->True,NumberMarks->True],FullForm]
